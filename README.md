# AI-Powered Mystery Game Chatbot

Welcome to the AI-Powered Mystery Game Chatbot project! This project leverages Google Cloud's AI capabilities to create an interactive and engaging mystery game experience based on user inputs. Users can specify the subject and difficulty of the game, and the AI will generate an immersive game scenario and play along with the user.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Google's Generative AI and Natural Language APIs in creating a dynamic and personalized gaming experience. Users can interact with a chatbot to generate a mystery game scenario, providing a fun and educational way to explore AI capabilities.

## Features

- Interactive chatbot for game creation
- Personalized mystery game scenarios based on user inputs
- Integration with Google Cloud's AI services
- Real-time feedback and interaction with the AI-generated game

## Architecture

![AI Learning Flowchart](./images/ai_learning_flowchart.png)

The architecture of the project includes the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based web application that provides an interactive user interface for chatting with the AI and displaying game scenarios.

2. **Backend**: Google Cloud functions handling API requests, AI model interaction, and game logic processing.

3. **AI Services**: Utilization of Google Cloud's Generative AI and Natural Language APIs to generate and process game content.

### Design Rationale

- **React for Frontend**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing for modular and reusable code.
- **Google Cloud APIs**: Provide powerful AI capabilities without needing to build custom models from scratch.
- **Interactive UI**: Enhances user engagement through real-time responses and feedback.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- A Google Cloud account with access to the Generative AI and Natural Language APIs
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-mystery-game-chatbot.git
   cd ai-mystery-game-chatbot
2. **Install dependencies**
3. **Create a .env file in the project root with your Google Cloud API key**
4. **Start the development server**


## Usage

- Choose a Subject and Difficulty: Start by selecting the subject and difficulty level for your mystery game.
- Interact with the Chatbot: Use the chatbot interface to describe the features you want in the game. The AI will generate a game scenario and guide you through the mystery.
- Play the Game: Follow the AI's prompts and solve the mystery based on the generated storyline.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
